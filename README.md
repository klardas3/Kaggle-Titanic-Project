# Kaggle-Titanic-Project

This is the first Kaggle competition that I entered and received a scored of 0.789.  The goal of this project was to predict which passengers in the test dataset ended up surviving by using the trained dataset to determine which variables were most important to factor into the model.

Used R for my exploratory data anlysis and randomForest model.

Prediction ended up being about 82% accurate.
